I am a computer science PhD student at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) [NDS2](https://nds2.ccs.neu.edu/) lab, advised by professor [Alina Oprea](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/alina/).

My research focuses on breaking machine learning systems. I am also interested in most aspects of ML-Security.
