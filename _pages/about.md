I am a computer scientist interested in machine learning security.
I received my PhD from [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/), where I worked in the [NDS2](https://nds2.ccs.neu.edu/) lab, advised by professor [Alina Oprea](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/alina/).

My research focuses on adversarial machine learning -- breaking ML systems -- with a particular focus on ML applications to security sensitive environments. I am also interested in most aspects of ML safety.
