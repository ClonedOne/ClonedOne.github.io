I am a Senior AI Safety Researcher at Microsoft, with the AI Red Team.
I received my PhD from [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/), where I worked in the [NDS2](https://nds2.ccs.neu.edu/) lab, advised by professor [Alina Oprea](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/alina/).

My main interest is in machine learning security and adversarial machine learning (breaking AI systems), especially when ML is applied to security sensitive environments. I am also interested in most aspects of AI safety.
