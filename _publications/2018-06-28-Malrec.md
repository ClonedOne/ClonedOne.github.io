Abstract - Malware  sandbox  systems  have  become  a  critical  part  ofthe  Internet’s  defensive  infrastructure.  These  systems  allow  malwareresearchers to quickly understand a sample’s behavior and effect on asystem. However, current systems face two limitations: first, for perfor-mance reasons, the amount of data they can collect is limited (typicallyto system call traces and memory snapshots). Second, they lack the abil-ity to performretrospective analysis—that is, to later extract featuresof the malware’s execution that were not considered relevant when thesample was originally executed. In this paper, we introduce a new mal-ware sandbox system,Malrec, which uses whole-system deterministicrecord and replay to capture high-fidelity, whole-system traces of mal-ware executions with low time and space overheads. We demonstrate theusefulness of this system by presenting a new dataset of 66,301 malwarerecordings collected over a two-year period, along with two preliminaryanalyses that would not be possible without full traces: an analysis ofkernel mode malware and exploits, and a fine-grained malware familyclassification based on textual memory access contents. TheMalrecsystem and dataset can help provide a standardized benchmark for eval-uating the performance of future dynamic analyses.
