In this post, I will try to visualize some interesting statistics extraced from a [wine reviews dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews). For this purpose I have developed two visualizations: one consisting in a choropleth map linked to a bar chart, and another consisting in a scatter plot with variable size (bubble chart). More details on the preprocessing of the data can be found in this [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/ClonedOne/exp_nbs/blob/master/wine_dataset_exploration.ipynb).

In the first visualization, the world map shows each country with its total number of wines reviewed on [WineEnthusiast](https://www.winemag.com/?s=&drink_type=wine), while the bar chart shows the average obtained score for each country. The two plots are linked together, and additional details are provided on mouseover.

With the second chart I wanted to dig deeper into the relationship between the price of a bottle, and the score it obtained during the review. As in the first visualization, additional details are available on mouseover.

Here is the source code for the two visualizations:

```javascript
{% include choropleth_wine.html %}
```

```javascript
{% include scoreprice_wine.html %}
```
