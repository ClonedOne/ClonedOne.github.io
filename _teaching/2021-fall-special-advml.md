Teaching assistant (TA) for the course [CY 7790: Special Topics in Security and Privacy: Machine Learning Security and Privacy](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/alina/classes/Fall2021/), taught by professor Alina Oprea.

Class description: Machine learning is increasingly being used for automated decisions in applications such as health care, finance, autonomous vehicles, personalized recommendations, and cyber security. These critical applications require strong guarantees on both the integrity of the machine learning models and the privacy of the user data used to train these models. The area of adversarial machine learning studies the effect of adversarial attacks against machine learning models and aims to design robust defense algorithms. In this course, we will study a variety of adversarial attacks on machine learning and deep learning systems that impact the security and privacy of these systems, and we will discuss the challenges of designing robust models.
